# sample-gis-datatypes

The application extends standard CUBA datatypes with geo-specific types from the opensource [JTS Topology Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTS_Topology_Suite):
1. Point
2. LineString
3. Polygon
4. Multi Polygon 

Using JTS your CUBA application amplifies its power with [Geometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTS_Topology_Suite#Geometric_functions), [Spatial structures and algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTS_Topology_Suite#Spatial_structures_and_algorithms) and [I/O capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTS_Topology_Suite#I.2FO_capabilities), coming along with the topology suite. So, your application has all essential features to become a full-scale geographic information system.

Note: the application uses the [Charts and Maps](https://www.cuba-platform.com/add-ons) premium add-on and requires the commercial subscription.
